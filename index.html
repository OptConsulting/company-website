				<h1>About Us</h1>

						<p>I completed my Master of Science in Nursing at Seattle Pacific University in 2000 after working for 11 years as an RN in a major Seattle hospital. I worked in a private Neurosurgical practice for over 20 years before joining Options Consulting PLLC. During that time, I gained extensive experience working with injured workers and those injured in motor vehicle accidents. My practice also included treatment of individuals with migraines through medication management and Botox therapy. I have treated patients with various orthopedic and neurosurgical conditions. I have worked with individuals from multiple cultural and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
						<p>I enjoy developing a relationship with my patients and getting to know them. Taking the time to get to the root of a condition helps with treatment of complex issues. Over the years of working with patients, I have found that there are a variety of treatment pathways to aid the patient in striving toward a better state of wellness. Use of both pharmaceutical and supplemental treatments can be very beneficial to help patients along the path to wellness.</p>

						<p>I have been a licensed clinical social worker since 1995, both in IL and WA (since 2018). I offer a solution focused, holistic approach to Individual and Couples Therapy. That means I help people by settings goals, and then helping them attain those goals. I help people balance their physical, emotional, and spiritual lives with a variety of techniques, including CBT and traditional psychotherapy. In addition to counseling, I can also help assist my clients with alternative treatments, like EFT, Reiki, or homeopathics.</p>
						<p>I have experience with all age groups in all sorts of dilemmas, like coping with a chronic illness/chronic pain, living with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), learning how to manage stress, and discovering new normals. I am contracted with Labor & Industries Master Level Therapist program & behavioral health. I also provide private therapy for individuals, families, and organizations. I help people cope with chronic pain, grief, depression/anxiety, and life transitions (divorce, co-parenting, etc.).</p>
